Differences or notes 
GENERAL NOTES:
in our full-stack applications, we were using one folder for the front and backend, and it was a React application using VITE, 
so we use the .cjs extension (common JS) for the backend files so that they would be interpreted correctly.

after npm init
$ npm i express dotenv mongoose colors
$ npm i -D nodemon

most steps for initializing and setting up server are the same
be careful of spacing in the .env file, don't include them around the equals sign

NOTE: the file naming is a little bit different
-----
controllers/goalController.js
routes/goalRoutes.js
-----
VERSUS
-----
controllers/goals.js
routes/goals.js
-----

If you are using Postman, at 27 minutes in, when we are working on setting the first goal...
choose Body
then choose x-www-form-encoded
then key is text and value is "My First Goal"


$ npm i express-async-handler
using this instead of try{}catch(err){}
